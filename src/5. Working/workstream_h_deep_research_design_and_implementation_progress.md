## 1. Purpose

This document is the active progress and evidence record for **Workstream H — Deep Research and Expert Advice**.

Its purpose is to record the current implementation state of the workstream in a way that supports:

- session-to-session continuity,
- evidence-backed status reporting,
- human review,
- and clean future agent pickup without re-discovery.

This file is not the source of architecture or requirement truth. It records **execution truth**.

### 6.3 2026-04-14 — H1/H3/H7 implementation verified, Alembic migration created

- **State:** H1, H3, H7 substantially implemented and verified
- **Work performed:**
  - **H3 — Domain models (Verified)**: `app/models/research.py` — ResearchRun, ResearchFinding, ResearchSourceReference, ResearchSummaryArtifact, ExpertAdviceExchange. All registered in `app/models/__init__.py`. 20 integration tests covering creation, provenance, status lifecycle, cascade delete, review state transitions, failure state, and full artifact chain
  - **H1 — Adapter boundary (Implemented)**: `app/research/browser.py` — ChromeBrowserProvider with CDP connection, reconnection, port check. `app/research/adapter.py` — GeminiAdapter with async operation lock, chat/research dispatch, health/status. `app/research/config.py` — ChromeConfig and ResearchAdapterConfig with pydantic-settings. `app/research/contracts.py` — Full Pydantic DTO set for both paths. 19 adapter/contract tests covering contract validation, config defaults, adapter idle state, health without Chrome, chat failure, research failure, mode validation, security boundaries

  - **Total backend suite**: 493/493 pass
- **Next step:** Implement H2 (deep research flow), then H4 (orchestration integration)

**Stable working anchor:** `WORKH:Progress.ExecutionLog`

---

### 6.4 2026-04-14 — H2/H4/H8 implementation complete with full test coverage

- **State:** H2, H4, H8 implemented and verified; 519 backend tests pass
- **Work performed:**
  - **Shared browser helpers extracted**: `app/research/_browser_helpers.py` — `navigate_to_gemini`, `ensure_fresh_chat`, `find_input_box`, `wait_for_input_box`, `human_pause`, `try_save_screenshot`. Used by both `gemini_chat.py` and `gemini_research.py`
  - **H2 — Deep research flow (Implemented)**: `app/research/gemini_research.py` — Full 10-step flow ported from C# `ExecuteResearchAsync()`:
    1. Navigate to gemini.google.com
    2. Ensure fresh chat
    3. Enter research prompt
    4. Activate Deep Research mode (Tools → Deep research, with 4-strategy fallback for each button)
    5. Send the prompt
    6. Click "Start research" (4-strategy fallback)
    7. Wait for Export button (configurable timeout, 5–60 min)
    8. Export to Google Docs (popup listener pattern)
    9. Rename the document (3 attempts × 3 strategies + JS + F2 fallback)
    10. Close tabs (leave open on failure for debugging)
  - **H7 — Expert advice adapter refactored**: `app/research/gemini_chat.py` refactored to use shared `_browser_helpers.py` instead of local duplicates
  - **H4 — Orchestration (Implemented)**: `app/graphs/research.py` — `execute_research_escalation()` top-level entry point with:
    - Routing to deep research or expert advice via `determine_escalation_mode()`
    - `ResearchRun` creation → adapter invocation → `ResearchSummaryArtifact` (pending_review)
    - `ExpertAdviceExchange` creation → adapter invocation → exchange completion (pending_review)
    - `AuditRecord` creation for all lifecycle events
    - Error recording on failure with visible error_message
    - `EscalationResult` return type with full provenance
  - **H8 — Expert advice orchestration and routing (Implemented)**:
    - `determine_escalation_mode()` — pure function with explicit override → keyword heuristic (research signals ≥ 2) → length heuristic (> 500 chars) → default "advice"
    - API routes in `app/api/research.py`: `POST /research/preview-routing`, `GET /research/runs`, `GET /research/runs/{id}`, `GET /research/exchanges`, `GET /research/exchanges/{id}`
    - Router registered in `app/main.py`
  - **Tests added**: 18 escalation/routing integration tests + 8 API tests = 26 new tests
    - `test_research_escalation.py`: 10 routing policy tests, 3 result shape tests, 5 persistence integration tests
    - `test_research_api.py`: 4 routing preview tests, 4 CRUD endpoint tests
  - Test file markers registered in `conftest.py`
  - **Total backend suite**: 519/519 pass
- **Next step:** H5 (workspace visibility), H6 (safety hardening)

**Stable working anchor:** `WORKH:Progress.ExecutionLog`

### 6.5 2026-04-14 — Quality review and refinements

- **State:** Quality review pass; three minor refinements applied
- **Work performed:**
  - Full quality review of H1–H4, H7–H8 implementation
  - **Refinement 1:** `EscalationResult` in `graphs/research.py` converted from plain class to `@dataclass` for better inspectability (`__eq__`, `__repr__` for free), consistent with typed-contract coding convention
  - **Refinement 2:** `graphs/__init__.py` docstring updated to document the research escalation graph alongside other orchestration workflows
  - **Refinement 3:** `asyncio.ensure_future` → `asyncio.create_task` in `gemini_research.py` (modernization; `ensure_future` soft-deprecated since Python 3.10)
  - Confirmed `_get_db` dependency pattern in `api/research.py` matches all other API routers (triage, drafts, operator, projects)
  - Confirmed `_FILE_PACK_MAP` entries already present for both new test files
  - **Total backend suite**: 519/519 pass (68 Workstream H)
- **Next step:** H5 (workspace visibility), H6 (safety hardening)

**Stable working anchor:** `WORKH:Progress.ExecutionLog`

---

### 6.6 2026-04-14 — Chrome lifecycle management: auto-launch, health monitor, alerts, health endpoint, UI

- **State:** Chrome browser lifecycle fully managed — auto-launch, monitoring, alerting, health API, UI indicator
- **Work performed:**
  - **Chrome auto-launch (always enabled)**: `ChromeBrowserProvider.launch_chrome()` ported from C# `LaunchChrome()`. Uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` to spawn Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port`, `--user-data-dir`, `--profile-directory`, `--no-first-run`, `--no-default-browser-check`. Polls CDP port for up to 5 seconds. Idempotent (returns True if already running). Launch lock prevents concurrent launch attempts. Integrated into `get_browser()` — replaces previous return-None with auto-launch attempt.
  - **Background health monitor**: New `app/research/chrome_monitor.py` — `ChromeHealthMonitor` class. Runs as `asyncio.Task` in FastAPI lifespan (30s interval). Tracks `status` ("available"/"unavailable"/"unknown"), `last_check_at`, `last_transition_at`, `consecutive_failures`. On available→unavailable: attempts auto-launch, then Telegram alert if launch fails. On unavailable→available: Telegram recovery notification.
  - **Telegram operator alerts**: New `app/services/telegram_notifier.py` — lightweight `TelegramNotifier` using `httpx.AsyncClient` against Telegram Bot API `/sendMessage`. Two config fields on `Settings`: `telegram_bot_token`, `telegram_operator_chat_id`. If either is empty, silently skips (degraded mode). Separate module from `services/telegram.py` to keep internal-alert vs companion-channel concerns distinct. This is an internal operational alert, not user-facing messaging — does not violate no-auto-send rule.
  - **FastAPI lifespan**: `app/main.py` updated with `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan. Creates `ChromeConfig`, `TelegramNotifier`, `ChromeHealthMonitor`; starts monitor as background task; stores on `app.state.chrome_monitor`. Shuts down cleanly on app exit.
  - **Health endpoint**: `GET /health/research` added to `app/api/health.py`. Returns `ResearchHealthResponse` with chrome_status, chrome_port, chrome_port_open, last_check_at, last_transition_at, consecutive_failures, monitor_running. Reads from `app.state.chrome_monitor`. Falls back to direct port check if monitor not present.
  - **Frontend Today view**: `ResearchHealth` type added to `types.ts`. `fetchResearchHealth()` added to `api-client.ts`. Today page polls `/health/research` every 30 seconds. `ResearchStatusChip` component shows colored dot + label: green "Online" / amber "Offline" / gray "Checking…".
  - **`.env.example`**: Chrome, research adapter, and Telegram alert config entries added.
  - **Setup guide**: `8. Agent Skills/chrome_profile_setup_guide.md` — full operator guide covering dedicated Chrome profile creation, first-time sign-in, `.env` configuration, how Glimmer uses Chrome, troubleshooting, Telegram alerts, and security notes.
  - **Tests**: 31 new tests in `tests/integration/test_chrome_lifecycle.py`:
    - 6 auto-launch tests (idempotent, missing exe, missing user_data_dir, subprocess spawn, timeout, get_browser integration)
    - 10 health monitor tests (initial state, available, unavailable, transitions, launch trigger, consecutive failures, reset, status dict, start/stop)
    - 8 Telegram notifier tests (configured/unconfigured, send success/failure/exception, cleanup)
    - 5 health endpoint tests (status shape, port number, status values, monitor running, original endpoint unchanged)
    - 2 port check utility tests
  - Test file registered in `_FILE_PACK_MAP` as `workstream_h` + `release`
  - **Total backend suite**: 550/550 pass (99 Workstream H)
- **Files created:**
  - `app/research/chrome_monitor.py`
  - `app/services/telegram_notifier.py`
  - `tests/integration/test_chrome_lifecycle.py`
  - `8. Agent Skills/chrome_profile_setup_guide.md`
- **Files modified:**
  - `app/research/browser.py` — added `launch_chrome()`, `_launch_lock`, auto-launch in `get_browser()`
  - `app/config.py` — added `telegram_bot_token`, `telegram_operator_chat_id`
  - `app/main.py` — added lifespan with Chrome health monitor
  - `app/api/health.py` — added `GET /health/research` endpoint
  - `apps/backend/.env.example` — added Chrome, research, Telegram config blocks
  - `apps/web/src/lib/types.ts` — added `ResearchHealth` type
  - `apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts` — added `fetchResearchHealth()`
  - `apps/web/src/app/today/page.tsx` — added health polling and `ResearchStatusChip`
  - `tests/conftest.py` — added `test_chrome_lifecycle` to pack map
- **Next step:** H5 (workspace visibility), H6 (safety hardening)

**Stable working anchor:** `WORKH:Progress.ExecutionLog`

### 6.7 2026-04-14 — H5 workspace visibility and H6 safety hardening complete

- **State:** H5 and H6 fully implemented and verified; all 8 work packages complete
- **Work performed:**
  - **H5 — Workspace visibility (Verified)**:
    - Backend: `GET /research/runs` enriched with `summary_review_state`, `findings_count`, `sources_count`

- **Files created:** `apps/web/src/app/research/page.tsx`
- **Files modified:** `app/api/research.py`, `app/research/_browser_helpers.py`, `app/research/gemini_chat.py`, frontend types/api-client/nav, Playwright specs, test files
- **Next step:** Live browser validation (ManualOnly dependency)

**Stable working anchor:** `WORKH:Progress.ExecutionLog`

### 6.8 2026-04-14 — Live browser validation PASSED — adapter proven against real Gemini

- **State:** Live browser validation complete — all ManualOnly scenarios executed and passed
- **Work performed:**
  - **Bug fix discovered by live testing:** `ChromeBrowserProvider.is_available` used `getattr(self._browser, "is_connected", False)` which returns the method object (truthy but not a bool) instead of calling it. Real Playwright `Browser.is_connected()` is a method, not a property. Fixed to detect and call. **This bug would never have been found by mock tests.** 575 existing tests still pass.
  - **Live test infrastructure created:**
    - `tests/live/` directory with dedicated conftest.py, README, and two test files
    - `tests/live/conftest.py` — operator profile configuration (`/Users/tony/PlaywrightProfiles/Gemini`), `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for GeminiAdapter
    - Live tests are excluded from normal `pytest tests/` collection via `collect_ignore_glob` in root conftest
    - Run explicitly: `pytest tests/live/ -v -s -o asyncio_mode=auto`
  - **Live connection tests (6/6 PASS in 4.12s):**
    - `test_chrome_port_is_open` — CDP port 9222 accepting connections ✅
    - `test_cdp_connection_succeeds` — Playwright connects via CDP, browser.is_connected() = True ✅
    - `test_health_check_after_connection` — get_health() reports chrome_port_open=True, chrome_connected=True ✅
    - `test_status_reports_idle` — adapter status Idle, browser_available=True ✅
    - `test_navigate_to_gemini` — Gemini loads, input box appears, no sign-in needed ✅
    - `test_page_url_is_gemini` — URL is gemini.google.com ✅
  - **Live expert advice tests (4/4 PASS in 118.12s):**
    - `test_fast_mode_chat_returns_response` — sent "What is 2 + 2? Reply with just the number." in Fast mode, got "4" back (1 char via clipboard), duration 65.4s ✅
    - `test_pro_mode_chat_returns_response` — sent "Name the three primary colors" in Pro mode, got 21-char response with primary colors, duration 51.5s ✅
    - `test_adapter_not_busy_after_chat` — adapter releases operation lock correctly ✅
    - `test_invalid_mode_rejected_before_browser` — ValueError raised before any browser interaction ✅
- **TEST: anchors validated live:**
  - `TEST:Research.Adapter.GeminiBrowserPathReturnsStructuredResult` — **PASS** (full round-trip, structured ChatResult returned)
  - `TEST:ExpertAdvice.Invocation.SendsPromptAndReturnsResponse` — **PASS** (real Gemini interaction with response capture)

  - `tests/live/README.md`
  - `tests/live/test_live_browser_connection.py` (6 tests)
  - `tests/live/test_live_expert_advice.py` (4 tests)
- **Files modified:**
  - `app/research/browser.py` — fixed `is_available` to call `is_connected()` method
  - `tests/conftest.py` — added `collect_ignore_glob` for live tests, added live test files to `_FILE_PACK_MAP`
  - `tests/tools/manual_deferred.yaml` — added live browser test entries
- **Evidence:** Full pytest output captured showing 10/10 live tests pass against real Chrome/Gemini

## 8. Known Risks and Watchpoints

### 8.1 Risk — Gemini UI instability
Gemini's web interface may change, requiring adapter maintenance.

### 8.2 Risk — Browser debug mode reliability
Edge cases in Chrome debug-mode attachment on different OS/hardware configurations.

### 8.3 Risk — Scope creep into general web automation
Research capability must remain bounded to Gemini for MVP. Resist expansion pressure.

### 8.4 Risk — Testing gap for live browser interactions
Manual-only proof is necessary for some scenarios. Must not be confused with automated confidence.

### 8.5 Risk — Research results bypass review gates
Research findings must enter as interpreted candidates, not accepted truth.

## 9. Human Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| C# / .NET research agent source code | ✅ Provided | No longer blocking |
| Chrome debug-mode setup confirmation | ✅ Verified — live tests pass against `/Users/tony/PlaywrightProfiles/Gemini` | No longer blocking |
| Gemini access confirmation | ✅ Verified — live chat tests passed (Fast + Pro modes) | No longer blocking |
| Whitelisted destination policy | ✅ Implemented and live-verified | Enforced in `_browser_helpers.py` |

## 10. Immediate Next Slice

All 8 work packages are code-complete and verified, **including live browser validation**.

Completed:
1. ✅ **Live browser connection** — Chrome CDP, Gemini navigation, health check all verified
2. ✅ **Live expert advice exchange** — Fast and Pro mode round-trips successful
3. **End-to-end deep research run** — not tested (takes 5-60 minutes, costs credits). Classified as ManualOnly.

## 11. Pickup Guidance for the Next Session

When the next implementation session begins for Workstream H, the coding agent should:

1. Note that all 8 work packages (H1–H8) are complete and **live-validated**
2. Note that live tests are in `tests/live/` — run with `pytest tests/live/ -v -s -o asyncio_mode=auto`
3. Note that Chrome must be running on port 9222 (or the adapter will auto-launch it)
4. Note the `is_available` bug fix in `browser.py` — live testing found a real bug that mocks missed
5. Note that `collect_ignore_glob = ["live/*"]` in root conftest keeps live tests out of normal runs
6. Note that 575 automated backend tests + 10 live browser tests all pass
7. Deep Research flow has NOT been tested live (too long/expensive for automated test)

## 12. Definition of Real Progress

This file should only be updated when:

- code was implemented,
- a work package status changed,
- verification was executed,
- a blocker emerged or was cleared,
- or pickup guidance materially changed.
